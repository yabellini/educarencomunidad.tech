We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment in any
form, including offensive communication, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, innapropriate physical
contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
professionally. Remember that sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not
appropriate.

People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Anyone violating these rules may be asked to leave the classroom at the sole
discretion of the instructors.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report
it by emailing ADDRESS, or if the violation occurs during a workshop or other
in-person event, by contacting the host directly at PHONE/TEXT. All reports
will be kept confidential.

This Code of Conduct was adapted from the example in the book
[Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/),
compiled by Greg Wilson. The example itself was based on the example policy from
the [Geek Feminism Wiki](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy),
created by the [Ada Initiative](https://adainitiative.org/)
and other volunteers.
